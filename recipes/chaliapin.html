    <p style="width: 600px;">
        The dish is exclusively made by S≈çma combined with the Japanese original dish, the Chaliapin Steak and the donburi 
        concept for his first Shokugeki. Although the dish was made with cheap ingredients that can be found in a supermarket, 
        the dish focused on both innovation and balance of the ingredients to fulfill the donburi mantra, "Dons are 
        completed in one bowl."
