        This dish is Yukihira Soma's innovated dish which was served to repel the vicious
        urban residential planner, Yaeko Minegasaki, from destroying his family restaurant. 
        Even though the meat was ruined due to the residential planner's schemes, Soma managed 
        to turn tides by using some of the groceries as his ingredients to create artificial 
        meat, the main ingredient being potatoes!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 white potatoes</li>
        <li>3 Eringi mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, or 2 medium white onions</li>
        <li>1 spring of rosemary</li>
        <li>Butter. 2 tablespoons recommended, but you could add more</li>
        <li>2 packs of thick-cut bacon</li>
        <li>250ml of red wine</li>
        <li>60ml of sake</li>
        <li>30ml of soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 spring of parsley or any garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
  
    <ul>
        <li>Peel the Potatoes</li>
        <li>Wash the potatoes then cut them into quarters or halves, depending on size.</li>
        <li>Chop the Mushrooms and Onions into Equally-sized Brunoise</li>
        <li>Steam potatoes until soft (about 15-20 minutes). </li>
        <li>Pan Fry the Onions and Mushrooms. Prep the pan with a tablespoon of butter. 
            Pan fry onions and mushrooms until caramelized or fully golden.</li>
        <li>Mash into small chunks in a large bowl. Do not mash too much.</li>
        <li>Combine the Onion and Mushroom Mix with the Potato Mash. 
            Mix until the ingredients are even in the bowl/li>
        <li>Pick the Rosemary</li>
        <li>Form the Fake Roast. Let the mix cool until touchable (more than 5 minutes). 
            Take all of the mix and form it into a log shape.</li>
        <li>Wrap the Roast in Bacon fully, try not to leave any gaps.</li>
        <li>Tie the roast with the twine.</li>
        <li>Bake at 375ºF or 190ºC for 30-45 minutes or until bacon is golden (cook longer for crispy bacon), turning halfway.</li>
        <li>Boil the Wine In the Frying Pan. Bring the wine to a boil (~10 minutes) on medium-high heat in a frying pan. The aim is to reduce it.</li>
        <li>Add the Butter, Sake, and Soy Sauce to the Wine </li>
        <li>When the baking is done, remove the twine and rosemary, they are not to be eaten.</li>
        <li>Pour the finished sauce onto the roast (make sure the roast is on a plate to hold the extra sauce). Pour slowly.</li>
        <li>Add a garnish to the top of the dish.</li>
        <li>Enjoy</li>
    </ul>
